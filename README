# Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple movie recommendation app I built using Python and Streamlit. You can choose a movie you like, and it will suggest 5 similar movies, along with their posters and links to learn more.

## How it works

- The app recommends 5 similar movies using a similarity model.
- You can also see 10 random movie suggestions every time you load the app.
- All posters are fetched using the TMDB API.
